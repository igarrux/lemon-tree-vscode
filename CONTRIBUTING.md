# 🍋 Contribute a lemon

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ** Limon Tree **!
This project has high standards, but without taxes. If you come wanting to contribute with a clean code, useful testing and with a touch of acid humor, you are in the right place.

---

## 🧪 Tests and coverage

- ** Minimum Athlette Coverage: 80%**.
- It is not required 100% because there are cases that only the creator knows well. I take into account of those.
- Add significant proof, they are not simulated by sport.

To verify:

`` Bash
Thread test -coberture
`` ``
